A Service is an application component that can perform long-running operations in the background, and it doesn't provide a user interface. 
Another application component can start a service, and it continues to run in the background even if the user switches to another application.
Additionally, a component can bind to a service to interact with it and even perform interprocess communication (IPC). 
For example, a service can handle network transactions, play music, perform file I/O, or interact with a content provider, all from the background.

These are the three different types of services:
Foreground : A foreground service performs some operation that is noticeable to the user. For example, 
an audio app would use a foreground service to play an audio track. Foreground services must display a Notification. 
Foreground services continue running even when the user isn't interacting with the app.
