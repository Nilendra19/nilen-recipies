Broadcasts overview
Android apps can send or receive broadcast messages from the Android system and other Android apps, 
similar to the publish-subscribe design pattern. These broadcasts are sent when an event of interest occurs.
 For example, the Android system sends broadcasts when various system events occur, such as when the system boots 
 up or the device starts charging. Apps can also send custom broadcasts, for example, to notify other apps of something
 that they might be interested in (for example, some new data has been downloaded).

Apps can register to receive specific broadcasts. When a broadcast is sent, the system automatically routes broadcasts 
to apps that have subscribed to receive that particular type of broadcast.

Generally speaking, broadcasts can be used as a messaging system across apps and outside of the normal user flow. 
However, you must be careful not to abuse the opportunity to respond to broadcasts and run jobs in the background 
that can contribute to a slow system performance, as described in the following video.
