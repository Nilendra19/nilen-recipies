Content providers offer granular control over the permissions for accessing data. You can choose to restrict access to a 
content provider from solely within your application, grant blanket permission to access data from other applications, 
or configure different permissions for reading and writing data. For more information on using content providers securely, 
see Security tips for storing data, as well as Content provider permissions.

You can use a content provider to abstract away the details for accessing different data sources in your application. 
For example, your application might store structured records in a SQLite database, as well as video and audio files. 
You can use a content provider to access all of this data, if you implement this development pattern in your application.

Also note that CursorLoader objects rely on content providers to run asynchronous queries and then return the results to 
the UI layer in your application. For more information on using a CursorLoader to load data in the background, 
see Running a query with a CursorLoader.
